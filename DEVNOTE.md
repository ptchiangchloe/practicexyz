### Additional Steps For Implementing Active Sections Page.

- Create the search function for the search bar to find the specific content for users. In the search bar, users can search any active sections' items and their sub-menu items by using the name of any active section item or its sub-menu items. It should have key word predictions from the user history record and also auto-complete functionality.

- Create pagination for the active section items. Each time the section should only present ten items for better readability. So that we need a pagination system for reference of all the items in the active section. This is a better way to present all the data for users.

- Create scrolling bar functionality for the active sections' sub-menu items. In the sub-menu section, if the sub-menu items are more than six items, we should automatically inject a scrolling bar to the right side of the section to limit the height of one sub-menu section.  

- Create a modal for 'CREATE SECTION' function. When users create a new section item for their page, if the input information is not too much, a modal could deliver a seamless user experience since the page won't be redirected to somewhere else. Users can either click the icon next too 'ACTIVE SECTIONS' in the active sections' header or click the 'CREATE SECTIONS' button.

- I notice there is a down arrow icon on the 'MORE ACTIONS' button, so I think it's a good idea to create a dropdown menu for 'MORE ACTIONS' function. When users want to take more actions on the page. A dropdown menu could quickly help them find the options they have.
