### Additional Steps For Implementing Active Sections Page.

- Create the search function for the search bar to find the specific content for users. In the search bar, users can search any active sections' items and their submenu items by using the name of any active section item or its submenu items. It should have key word predictions from the user history record and also auto-complete functionality.

- Create "LOAD MORE" button to let users can do infinite scrolling for the active sections items. Every time the page will load 6 or 7 more items. It will let users keep loading items until all the items are on the page.

- Create hover event on the active sections item when users expand the submenu by clicking the down arrow button or collapse the submenu by clicking the up arrow button. It's a prominent way to draw users' eyeball to the target.

- Create a modal for 'CREATE SECTION' function. When users create a new section item for their page, a modal could deliver a seamless user experience since the page won't be redirected to somewhere else. Users can either click the icon next too 'ACTIVE SECTIONS' in the active sections' header or click the 'CREATE SECTIONS' button. If the input is not too complicated, a context menu could be considered as well.

- I notice there is a down arrow icon on the 'MORE ACTIONS' button, so I think it's a good idea to create a dropdown menu for 'MORE ACTIONS' function. When users want to take more actions on the page. A dropdown menu could quickly help them find the options they have.
